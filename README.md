NeoRoot.lua
---

Keep your `cwd` in the right place by defining your own project roots, dynamically or statically :)

### Disclamer

This is my first plugin for neovim. I just copy-paste the code from my working `init.lua`, so I'm not even sure about whether you could install it successfully or not, but I will try my best to make it work recently.

### Shortcuts & Usage


Two shortcuts, customizable:

- `<Leader>prr`, where `prr` means "project root reset"
- `<Leader>pra`, where `pra` means "project root append"

### DEMO

(to be recorded.)
